    <p class="intro">We are a local, family run cupcake shop that is located in the heart of Seattle. We specialize in helping people get diabeties and we do have insulin at the front counter if you need it.</p>

    <h2>Cupcake Phenomenon Fabulous Event</h2>
    <p class="event">This year, we decided to do something extra special for our valued Customers. Any Customers who can provide three punched cards can come to our tasting event on Thursday, July 17 to sample our experimental cupcake flavors. Party favors and noisemakers are included.</p>
    <p class="event">Last year, we had several people try to attend in their bathing suits. We request that you abstain from this behavior. We know it's hot that time of year, but shoes and shirt are required. And pants. Especially pants.</p>
